**Course Description:** This innovative course introduces students to computer science through practical, physics-based programming projects. Students develop programming skills using JavaScript while creating interactive simulations that model real-world phenomena. Beginning with basic coding concepts and progressing to complex physics engines, students learn both independently and collaboratively, applying the software development life-cycle model throughout their work.

**Course Length:** 18 weeks **Prerequisites:** None **Required Resources:**

- Computer lab with JavaScript development environment
- Web browsers
- Project management software
- Version control system
- Documentation tools
- It is strongly suggested that computers have access to internet and working IDE
